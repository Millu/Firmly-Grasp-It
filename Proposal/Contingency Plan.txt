Contingency Plan

Our main plain to try and navigate to all of the points successfully using smooth arcs as described in the Braitenberg vehicles report. However, this may not be feasible due to the lack of predictability in turning between robots on a day to day basis. This also may not be feasible as the robot will have to compute the angles and keep track of its current angle relative to the next point. If this does not work, we will implement a navigation method where robot will turn only at 90 degree angles, resulting in movement in a grid-like pattern to navigate to all of the points.
