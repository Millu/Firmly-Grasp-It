Before the pre-computation period, the Quartus projects will have been compiled and the DE2Bot will have been plugged into the computer. During the 60 second pre-computation period, each of the points will be entered into a 2-column by 12-row csv document. A C++ program will then be executed to read in the previously mentioned csv file and update the assembly file with the order of the coordinates that the DE2Bot will target. In the ideal case, the program would perform calculations parallelized multiple threads to determine the most efficient path using brute force. Should these calculations be found to take longer than 10 seconds, the greedy algorithm will be implemented instead. If implementing an optimization during the pre-computation period present any problems, no optimization will be performed. After the program executes, the assembly file will be compiled. Then, in Quartus, the Memory Initialization File will be updated. Finally, the program will be sent to the DE2Bot, the DE2Bot will be physically moved to its starting position, and then the initial calibration switch will be flipped and push button will be pressed to start the main program.
