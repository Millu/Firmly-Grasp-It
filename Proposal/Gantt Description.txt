In the figure above, “Skeleton Code” refers to an outline of the program structure. This outline includes a loop in main that goes through each of the points, calculates the angle and distance the DE2Bot needs to travel, leaving space to actually add the physical turning and movement. “Course Navigation” refers to the full simulation of having the DE2Bot move through every point. “Preprocessing” refers to the input of random points into a CSV file, then possibly running an optimization algorithm and updating the assembly file with the results.
The official major milestones are the Proposal Due Date, Final Demo Presentation Date, and the Design Report Due Date. The Proposal Due Date has already passed, and the figure above depicts how work will be performed so that the other deadlines will be met.
The work on this project has been divided into two groups: Nick Fahrenkrog and Mitch Donley in one group, and Ivan Jiminez and Millun Atluri in the other group. The first group will be working on writing the assembly code to make sure that the DE2Bot can move to each of the points specified. The other group will focus on the preprocessing stage (including the optimization algorithm), and compiling together the files from the written design report. All other tasks will be performed as a collective, with smaller subtasks potentially assigned by the group leader, Ivan.
